How to interface Piozoelectric sensor with arduino uno
===========================================================
i have set threshold to be 20
when pressure is exerted on the sensor, the led lights up
the serial monitor prints the value when threshold is either up or low 
connection
==============================
arduion       piezoelecric
================================
 3.3v           + pin
 GND            - pin
 A4             S pin

arduino         led
===========================
digital pin2    Anode 
GND             Cathode pin 
For me the sensor is working
